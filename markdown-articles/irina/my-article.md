ELSA, English Language Speech Assistant, is a fun and engaging app specially designed to help you improve your English pronunciation. ELSA's artificial intelligence technology was developed using voice data of people speaking English with various accents. This allows ELSA to recognize the speech patterns of non-native speakers, setting it apart from most other voice recognition technologies.
