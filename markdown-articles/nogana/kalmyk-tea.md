# Jomba - Kalmyk tea

Kalmyk tea, despite its direct nationality, is drunk by all Caucasian peoples and residents of the southern Russian regions. The drink mentioned by A.S. Pushkin himself (read about how the great poet drank jomba at Kalmyk wagons in the Journey to Arzrum diaries)! A drink that you will **love for a lifetime**, or that you will taste once in a lifetime! 

*Note: only special tiled green tea is suitable for jomba (pu-erh tea and regular green tea will not work, unfortunately!).*

- bay leaf 2 pcs.
- black pepper 8 peas
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg

1. Mash / cut the tea, crush it. Pour with water, let it boil and cook over low heat for ten minutes.

2. Pour in some milk, bring to a boil. So, little by little, pour in all the milk.

3. Add salt and spices.

4. Boil for 5-7 minutes. Let it brew under a closed lid. Stir the tea after 10 minutes.

5. Further, such a custom: scoop up the tea with a ladle and pour it back into the pot from a low height. Everyone has it differently: someone needs to repeat this procedure 46 times, someone does 99 (!).
