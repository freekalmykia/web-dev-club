# ESL Homework - Reasons against Second Amendment

I can find only two reasons against Second Amendment.

1. Guns stored in homes can be in the reach of kids. We have a stories when guns in the arms of kids lead to deaths of parents or other kids. For example school shootings.
2. Easy access to guns can be a reason of street violence.
